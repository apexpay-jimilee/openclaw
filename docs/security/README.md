## Security Assessment Program

The OpenClaw security assessment program conducts comprehensive risk analysis across five critical domains:

1. **Tool Safety & Sandbox Escape** - Execution isolation and command injection risks
2. **Data Exfiltration & Privacy** - Data flow analysis and PII protection
3. **Secrets & Credential Management** - Credential lifecycle and storage security
4. **Supply Chain & Dependencies** - Third-party risk and vulnerability management
5. **Network & Runtime Isolation** - Network exposure and process boundaries

**Status**: See [Assessments Directory](./assessments/) for current status and findings.
